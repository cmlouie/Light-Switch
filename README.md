Please download the xcodeproj and test the app out on an iPhone X or newer running iOS 13.

## Similarities to Apple Home App
- Overall feel (swiping, tapping to toggle switch)
- Haptic feedback
- Color scheme
- Icon symbols
- Text layout and font

## Future improvements
- When pulling past the boundaries of the switch view, have the switch stretch a tiny amount to indicate to the user that they reached the limit
- Animate the lamp icon instead of switching between the off and on images

## Acknowledgement
Created by Christopher Louie on Oct 15, 2019. Design inspired by Apple Home App.
